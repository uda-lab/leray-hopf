# Fréchet–Kolmogorov L²-precompactness criterion (Pillar B, Stream B)

**Milestone id:** `frechet-kolmogorov` (Stream B — discharge the isolated FK hypothesis).

This file **discharges** the isolated analytic frontier
`FrechetKolmogorovInput` defined in `RellichBall.lean` (the standard Fréchet–Kolmogorov /
Riesz L²-precompactness criterion that mathlib still lacks).  It produces a genuine term

  `frechetKolmogorov_holds : FrechetKolmogorovInput`,

whose type is copied **verbatim** from `RellichBall.lean` — no weakening, no added
hypotheses.  Once proved, `localRellichInput_of_frechetKolmogorov frechetKolmogorov_holds`
becomes an *unconditional* `LocalRellichInput`, which later (a separate capstone) lets
`SolutionInterfaces.lean` rewrite `spatial_compactness_R3` from `axiom` to `theorem`.

## What `FrechetKolmogorovInput` actually demands (copied from `RellichBall.lean`)

A family `S : Set (L2ballR3 R)`, with a global representative `rep f : L2VF_R3` for each
`f ∈ S` (`restrictToBall R (rep f) = f`), that is

* uniformly L²-bounded inside the ball (`∀ f ∈ S, ‖f‖ ≤ C`),
* uniformly L²-bounded GLOBALLY on the representative (`∀ f ∈ S, ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` — the standard
  Riesz full-mass control), and
* uniformly translation-equicontinuous in the GLOBAL L²-norm
  (`∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ f ∈ S, ∀ h, ‖h‖ < δ → ‖translate_L2VF h (rep f) − rep f‖ < ε`)

is contained in a compact `K ⊆ L2ballR3 R`.

It mentions NO Sobolev/gradient/`viscousFormSq`/`L2Sigma`/subsequence/limit object — it is
the pure abstract compactness *criterion*.  This file proves exactly that criterion.

## The standard FK route (decomposition into local lemmas)

The proof is the classical mollification + Arzelà–Ascoli + total-boundedness argument:

1. **Equicontinuity / equiboundedness of the mollified family.**
   `mollified_family_equicontinuous` + `mollified_family_uniformly_bounded`: the explicit
   representative `mollifyRep K (rep f)`, restricted to `x ∈ B_R`, is uniformly bounded and
   uniformly equicontinuous (Young's inequality `‖(η ⋆ g) x‖ ≤ ‖η‖₂‖g‖₂` + the kernel-only modulus
   of `η`).  The mass factor `‖g‖₂` localizes to the kernel-support enlargement `B_{R+r}` (the
   only region the kernel reaches from `B_R`), so these bounds need only the ENLARGED-BALL bound
   `‖restrictToBall (R+r) (rep f)‖ ≤ C`, which is supplied directly from the criterion's GLOBAL
   bound `hbddGlobal : ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` by ball-mass monotonicity (the strengthened
   `FrechetKolmogorovInput`, round 4).  They are stated for the genuine smooth representative
   `mollifyRep` on `B_R`,
   NOT for an arbitrary operator `L2VF_R3 → L2VF_R3` (for which they would be false — e.g. `ρ = id`).
2. **Arzelà–Ascoli ⇒ total boundedness of the mollified family in C(ball), hence in L²(ball).**
   `mollified_family_totallyBounded_L2`.
3. **Mollification (approximate identity), assembled from steps 1–2.**  Convolve every family
   member with a CONCRETE smooth compactly-supported scalar kernel `K : MollifierKernel`, whose
   explicit continuous representative is `mollifyRep K f = η ⋆ f`.
   `convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`: the convolutions approximate the originals in L² *uniformly
   over the family*, with the rate controlled by the uniform translation modulus (this is where
   the FK hypothesis is consumed), delegating the total-boundedness conjunct to step 2.
4. **Total-boundedness transfer.**  `totallyBounded_of_uniform_approx`: a set that is
   uniformly ε-approximable (step 3) by a totally bounded set (step 2) is itself totally
   bounded; with completeness of `L2ballR3 R` this gives precompactness
   (`isCompact_iff_totallyBounded_isComplete`).

The top-level `frechetKolmogorov_holds` assembles 1–4 into the FK criterion.

## History: `RellichBall.lean`'s residual `sorry` (`integrable_viscous_integrand_of_memH1`)

That residual `sorry` (H¹ ⇒ concrete `(2π)²‖ξ‖²`-weighted L²-integrability of the L²-Fourier
transform) was eventually discharged directly in `RellichBall.lean`, via a **self-contained**
`private` Bessel-weight helper chain there (`RellichBall.memH1_weightedL2_integrable_R` and
its supporting lemmas) — NOT via a helper exposed from this file, since `RellichBall.lean` is
*upstream* of `FrechetKolmogorov.lean` (this file imports `RellichBall`, not the reverse), so a
helper defined here could never have been importable there. This file used to carry its own
now-orphaned copy of that same Bessel-weight scaffolding (`besselWeightC` family,
`memH1_weightedL2_integrable`) built on the aspiration described in the superseded version of
this section; it had zero callers anywhere in the repo (confirmed by repo-wide grep) and was
deleted (issue #113 PR-2). See `RellichBall.lean`'s own docstring at
`memH1_weightedL2_integrable_R` for the (intentionally duplicated, not further refactored here)
self-contained route actually used.

## Honest scope (no overclaim) — ONE isolated frontier remains

This file is **fully proved (no `sorry`)**.  Both named analytic cores
(`young_convolution_memLp_L2`, `convolution_sub_L2_le_translation_modulus`), all assembly
plumbing, and the deliverable `frechetKolmogorov_holds` are proved.  The previously-isolated
`Lp`-valued Bochner-integral coeFn identity `convL2_coeFn_ae`
(`coeFn(∫ h, K.η h • τ_h g) =ᵐ mollifyRep K g`) is now DISCHARGED by the finite-set
inner-product-duality / shear-Fubini route (`convL2_setIntegral_inner`,
`mollifyRep_setIntegral_inner`, `fubini_integrand_integrable`, then
`ae_eq_of_forall_setIntegral_eq_of_sigmaFinite`) — mathlib lacks the coeFn lemma directly and the
raw `ℝ³×ℝ³` double integral is not absolutely convergent, so the proof restricts Fubini to
finite-measure sets where absolute convergence holds.  No `axiom`/`opaque`/`constant` is introduced
and no `sorry` remains.  `frechetKolmogorov_holds` is a genuine DISCHARGE of the existing
`FrechetKolmogorovInput` type (not a new isolated hypothesis).

**Codex Gate round 3 (high) — local helper bounds vs. the deliverable, RESOLVED upstream.**
The mollifier-family helper bounds (steps 1–3) are TRUE only with an ENLARGED-BALL mass bound on
the kernel-support enlargement `B_{R + r}` (`r =` kernel support radius `K.supportRadius`), since
the mollified field on `B_R` only sees the original field over `B_{R+r}`.  A single-radius ball
bound on `B_R` plus a translation modulus does NOT control annulus mass on `B_{R+r} ∖ B_R`, so
the enlarged-ball bound is not recoverable from those two data alone.  This is now fixed UPSTREAM:
`RellichBall.FrechetKolmogorovInput` was strengthened to ALSO carry a uniform GLOBAL L²-norm bound
`hbddGlobal : ∀ f ∈ S, ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` (the standard Riesz full-mass control), from which any
enlarged-ball bound `‖restrictToBall (R + r₀) (rep f)‖ ≤ C` follows immediately by monotonicity of
ball mass in the radius (`‖restrictToBall R' g‖ ≤ ‖g‖`).  Hence the helper chain's `hbdEnl` is now
supplied directly from the criterion's own data, and `frechetKolmogorov_holds` is a pure
(proof-body) discharge — no upstream blocker remains.

## Architecture (standalone sibling)

Imports `R3.RellichBall` (for `FrechetKolmogorovInput`, `translate_L2VF`, `L2ballR3`,
`restrictToBall`), plus targeted mathlib (convolution + uniform-space compactness).  It does
NOT import `SolutionInterfaces.lean` and does NOT edit the root `LerayHopf.lean` (deferred wiring).

/-! ### Concrete mollifier — kernel data and explicit continuous representative

The Codex statement-gate flagged that mollifier-family bounds are FALSE when phrased for an
*arbitrary* operator `ρ : L2VF_R3 → L2VF_R3` (e.g. `ρ = id`): an L²-bounded family need not have
a pointwise sup bound or an equicontinuous representative, and pointwise evaluation of an `Lp`
class is not a faithful smooth representative.  The fix is to fix a CONCRETE mollification by an
explicit smooth, compactly supported scalar kernel `η : Domain3 → ℝ`, and to state every bound
for an EXPLICIT continuous representative

  `mollifyRep η f x := ∫ y, η (x − y) • (f y) ∂volume`,

which is a genuine pointwise-defined function of `x` (a vector-valued convolution `η ⋆ f`).  The
kernel-smoothness/compact-support hypotheses are exactly what make the bounds TRUE (Young's
inequality on the sup norm; equicontinuity from the kernel's own modulus). -/

/-- **Kernel data for the mollifier.**  A scalar approximate-identity kernel
`η : Domain3 → ℝ` that is smooth (`ContDiff ℝ ⊤`) and compactly supported — i.e. an admissible
mollifier.  Bundling the smoothness/compact-support hypotheses makes the family bounds below
genuinely true (rather than vacuously or falsely true for an arbitrary operator). -/

  on `B_{R+r}` is exactly what Young / Arzelà–Ascoli on `B_R` need; it is obtained from the

/-- **Explicit continuous representative of the mollified field.**

`mollifyRep K f x = ∫ y, K.η (x − y) • (f y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) ∂volume` is the
genuine pointwise-defined vector-valued convolution `η ⋆ f`.  Because `K.η` is smooth and
compactly supported, this integral converges for every `x` and defines a smooth (in particular
continuous) function `Domain3 → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` — a *faithful* representative of the
mollified L²-class, on which pointwise sup and equicontinuity bounds are legitimate.

This is the concrete operator the family lemmas below are stated for, replacing the unsound
arbitrary `ρ : L2VF_R3 → L2VF_R3`. -/

  fun x => ∫ y : Domain3, K.η (x - y) • (f y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3))
    ∂(volume : Measure Domain3)

/-- **Existence of a normalized mollifier kernel of arbitrarily small support.**

For every `r > 0` there is a `MollifierKernel K` whose support radius is `≤ r`.  It is the
`ContDiffBump (0 : Domain3)`-mollifier with `rIn = r/3 < rOut = r/2`, normalized to unit mass by
`ContDiffBump.normed volume`.  The resulting `K.η = bump.normed volume` is `C^∞`
(`contDiff_normed`), nonnegative (`nonneg_normed`), of mass one (`integral_normed`), and supported
in `closedBall 0 (r/2)` (`tsupport_normed_eq`), so `K.supportRadius = r/2 ≤ r`.

This is the concrete approximate-identity kernel feeding `convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`: choosing
support `< δ` (the FK uniform translation-modulus radius for the target `ε`) drives the uniform
L²-approximation rate. -/

/-! ### Mollifier sub-library — kernel as a scalar L²-class and reusable estimates

The two mollifier-family lemmas (`mollified_family_uniformly_bounded`,
`mollified_family_equicontinuous`) are short consequences of three reusable estimates about the
CONCRETE kernel.  We factor them out as named lemmas so each family lemma becomes a bounded
derivation rather than a monolithic analytic proof:

* `kernel_translate_L2_tendsto` — the kernel's own L²-translation modulus vanishes (η smooth +
  compact support ⇒ uniformly continuous ⇒ DCT).  This is the *uniform* (g-independent) modulus
  driving equicontinuity.
* `mollifyRep_sup_le` — Cauchy–Schwarz/Young pointwise sup bound on `B_R`, with the mass factor
  localized to the kernel-reach enlargement `B_{R + K.supportRadius}`.
* `mollifyRep_sub_le` — the convolution-difference estimate on `B_R`, factoring the modulus of
  `mollifyRep K f` through the kernel's L²-translation modulus times the enlarged-ball mass.

To state the kernel modulus we coerce the scalar kernel `K.η : Domain3 → ℝ` into the scalar L²
space `Lp ℝ 2 volume` (`kernelL2R`) and use the scalar translation `translate_L2R` (the scalar
mirror of `translate_L2VF`, same measure-preserving `(· + h)` plumbing). -/

For a `MollifierKernel K`, the map `h ↦ ‖translate_L2R h (kernelL2R K) − kernelL2R K‖` tends to `0`
as `h → 0` in `Domain3`.  `K.η` is smooth with compact support, hence uniformly continuous and
dominated by a fixed compactly supported `L²` envelope, so dominated convergence gives L²-continuity
of translation of the kernel.  This is the *uniform* (g-independent) modulus that drives the

/-- **Helper 3 — convolution-difference estimate (modulus of the mollified field).**

For `x, y ∈ closedBall 0 R`, the increment of the mollified field is bounded by the enlarged-ball
mass of `f` times the kernel's own L²-translation modulus at the shift `x − y`:

  `‖mollifyRep K f x − mollifyRep K f y‖`
      `≤ ‖restrictToBall (R + K.supportRadius) f‖ · ‖translate_L2R (x − y) (kernelL2R K) − kernelL2R K‖`.

After the change of variables `z = x − y'` the difference is `∫ (K.η(x−·) − K.η(y−·)) • f`, and
Cauchy–Schwarz factors it as (kernel translation-modulus)·(enlarged-ball mass of `f`). -/

/-! ### FK step 0 — preliminaries: global Young + vector Minkowski analytic cores

The two genuinely-missing analytic facts behind `convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`, isolated as
named helper SIGNATURES (bodies deferred to `lean-prover`):

* `young_convolution_memLp_L2` — GLOBAL Young inequality `‖η ⋆ g‖₂ ≤ ‖η‖₁ · ‖g‖₂`: the convolution
  `mollifyRep K g` is itself in `L²(ℝ³)` (not just locally on `B_R`), with its `L²`-norm bounded by
  the kernel's `L¹`-mass times `‖g‖₂`.  Mathlib has `MeasureTheory.convolution` continuity / Young
  on `L^p` only fragmentarily for this vector-valued, measure-`volume` setting.
* `convolution_sub_L2_le_translation_modulus` — the vector-valued Minkowski integral inequality
  `‖∫ F(h) dh‖₂ ≤ ∫ ‖F(h)‖₂ dh` applied to `(η ⋆ g) − g = ∫ h, η(h) (τ_h g − g) dh` (mass-one
  kernel), yielding `‖η ⋆ g − g‖₂ ≤ ∫ h, η(h) · ‖τ_h g − g‖₂ dh`.  Combined with the FK uniform
  translation modulus and `K.supportRadius < δ`, this gives the uniform `< ε` approximation rate.
-/

/-! ### Shared Bochner-`Lp` integral primitive for the two analytic cores

Both analytic cores (`young_convolution_memLp_L2`, `convolution_sub_L2_le_translation_modulus`)
follow from a single identity expressing the `L²`-class of the convolution `mollifyRep K g` as an
`Lp`-valued Bochner integral of kernel-weighted translates:

  `toLp (mollifyRep K g) = ∫ h, K.η h • translate_L2VF h g ∂volume`   (an `L2VF_R3`-valued integral).

Once this identity and the Bochner-integrability of `h ↦ K.η h • translate_L2VF h g` are in hand,
`MeasureTheory.norm_integral_le_integral_norm` (valid in the Banach space `L2VF_R3`) plus
`‖translate_L2VF h g‖ = ‖g‖` and the kernel facts (`nonneg`, `mass_one`) deliver both cores. -/

/-! ### Discharging the coeFn identity `convL2_coeFn_ae` — finite-set inner-product duality

The coeFn identity `⇑(convL2 K g) =ᵐ mollifyRep K g` is the last genuine frontier.  We prove it
by the route advertised in its docstring, broken into reusable pieces:

* `mollifyRep_apply_bound` / `continuous_mollifyRep` / `integrableOn_mollifyRep` — the pointwise
  convolution `mollifyRep K g` is globally bounded (Cauchy–Schwarz, `‖kernelL2R K‖·‖g‖`),
  continuous, hence integrable on every finite-measure set;
* `convL2_setIntegral_inner` — pairing the `Lp`-valued integral `convL2 K g` with a constant `c`
  over a finite set `s`, commuting the inner product through the Bochner integral
  (`integral_inner` / `ContinuousLinearMap.integral_comp_comm`) and `inner_indicatorConstLp_*`;
* `mollifyRep_setIntegral_inner` — the matching scalar double integral for `mollifyRep`, with the
  finite-set Fubini (`integral_integral_swap`) and shear (`measurePreserving_prod_add`) made
  legitimate by absolute convergence on the FINITE set `s`;
* the two agree (via `K.even`), so `ae_eq_of_forall_setIntegral_eq_of_sigmaFinite` closes it. -/

/-- Global Cauchy–Schwarz / Young sup bound for the pointwise convolution, valid at EVERY `x`
(no ball localization): `‖mollifyRep K g x‖ ≤ ‖kernelL2R K‖ · ‖g‖`.  Same Cauchy–Schwarz as
`mollifyRep_sup_le` but with the trivial enlarged ball `B = univ`. -/

/-- **The isolated coeFn identity — now PROVED (no `sorry`, no axiom).**

The coeFn of the `Lp`-valued Bochner integral `convL2 K g = ∫ h, K.η h • τ_h g` agrees a.e. with
the pointwise convolution `mollifyRep K g x = ∫ y, K.η (x − y) • g y`.

mathlib provides **no** "coeFn of an `Lp`-valued Bochner integral as the scalar integral of
coeFns" lemma for this `volume`-on-ℝ³ vector-valued setting, and the raw double integral is NOT
absolutely convergent on `ℝ³ × ℝ³` (`φ, g ∈ L²` are not `L¹`), so a naive global scalar Fubini is
unavailable.  The honest provable route, carried out here:

* both `convL2 K g` (an `Lp` element) and `mollifyRep K g` (continuous, globally bounded by
  `mollifyRep_apply_bound`, hence `integrableOn_mollifyRep`) are integrable on every finite-measure
  set, so `ae_eq_of_forall_setIntegral_eq_of_sigmaFinite` reduces the goal to
  `∫_s convL2 K g = ∫_s mollifyRep K g` for all finite measurable `s`;
* equality of two `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` vectors is tested by `ext_inner_left`: it suffices to
  show `⟪c, ∫_s convL2 K g⟫ = ⟪c, ∫_s mollifyRep K g⟫` for every `c`;
* `convL2_setIntegral_inner` rewrites the LHS to `∫ h, K.η h · ∫ x in s, ⟪c, g (x+h)⟫` and
  `mollifyRep_setIntegral_inner` rewrites the RHS to `∫ x in s, ∫ h, K.η h · ⟪c, g (x+h)⟫`;
* on the FINITE set `s` the double integral of `F (x,h) = K.η h · ⟪c, g (x+h)⟫` is absolutely
  convergent (`fubini_integrand_integrable`), so `integral_integral_swap` (Fubini over
  `(volume.restrict s).prod volume`) exchanges the two orders. -/

/-! ### FK step 1 — equiboundedness + equicontinuity of the mollified family -/

/-- **FK step 1 (equiboundedness).**  The CONCRETE mollified family has a uniform sup bound on
its explicit representative.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported kernel `K`, convolving an L²-bounded family with `K.η`
gives a family with a common `L^∞`-bound via Young's inequality
`‖η ⋆ g‖_∞ ≤ ‖η‖₂ · ‖g‖₂` (the kernel is in `L²` because it is continuous with compact support).
The bound is stated for the genuine representative `mollifyRep K (rep f)`, NOT for the pointwise
evaluation of an arbitrary `Lp`-class.

**Norm-correctness (Codex Gate round 3 → resolved round 4).**  Young's inequality bounds
`‖η ⋆ g‖_∞` by `‖η‖₂‖g‖₂`.  The OUTPUT bound is needed only on `x ∈ B_R` (the region the
ball-restriction of `mollifyRep` keeps), and there `mollifyRep K (rep f) x = ∫ y, η(x−y)·rep f(y)`
only sees `rep f` over the kernel-reach `B_{R + K.supportRadius}` (since `η` is supported in
`closedBall 0 K.supportRadius`).  Hence the local hypothesis is the ENLARGED-BALL bound
`hbdEnl : ∀ f ∈ S, ‖restrictToBall (R + K.supportRadius) (rep f)‖ ≤ C`
on the kernel-support enlargement `B_{R+r}` — exactly what Young needs on `B_R`.  This bound is
supplied at the call site directly from `FrechetKolmogorovInput`'s GLOBAL bound
`hbddGlobal : ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` by ball-mass monotonicity (`‖restrictToBall (R+r) g‖ ≤ ‖g‖`), so
there is no longer any upstream gap: the criterion's own strengthened data furnishes it.  The
output bound is stated for `x ∈ B_R` only. -/

/-- **FK step 1 (equicontinuity).**  The CONCRETE mollified family is uniformly equicontinuous on
its explicit representative.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported kernel `K`, the modulus of continuity of `η ⋆ g` is
controlled by `‖g‖₂` times the (kernel-only) modulus of `η`
(`‖(η ⋆ g)(x) − (η ⋆ g)(y)‖ ≤ ‖g‖₂ · ‖τ_{x−y} η − η‖₂`), uniformly over the L²-bounded family —
because `K.η`, being smooth with compact support, is uniformly continuous with an L²-modulus
independent of `g`.  Stated for `mollifyRep K (rep f)`, NOT for an arbitrary operator.

**Norm-correctness (Codex Gate round 3 → resolved round 4).**  Restricting attention to
`x, y ∈ B_R` (the region the ball-restriction keeps) and bounding the difference quotient by the
kernel modulus localizes the mass factor `‖g‖₂` to the kernel-reach `B_{R + K.supportRadius}`:
the relevant inequality is
`‖(η⋆g)(x)−(η⋆g)(y)‖ ≤ ‖restrictToBall (R+K.supportRadius) g‖ · ‖τ_{x−y}K.η − K.η‖₂` for
`x, y ∈ B_R`.  Hence the local hypothesis is the ENLARGED-BALL bound `hbdEnl` on `B_{R+r}`, which
the call site supplies from `FrechetKolmogorovInput`'s GLOBAL bound `hbddGlobal : ‖rep f‖ ≤ C`
by ball-mass monotonicity (no upstream gap).  The equicontinuity conclusion is stated for
`x, y ∈ B_R` only. -/

/-- **Abstract Arzelà–Ascoli + sup→L² transfer.**  Let `Φ f` be a representative function for the
L²(B_R)-class `restrictToBall R (ρf f)` (`hΦae`).  If the family `{Φ f : f ∈ S}` is uniformly
bounded (`hB`) and uniformly equicontinuous (`hequi`) on the compact ball `B_R`, then the image
`{restrictToBall R (ρf f) : f ∈ S}` is totally bounded in `L²(B_R)`.

The proof is the classical Arzelà–Ascoli net construction: a finite `δ`-net of centers in the
compact `B_R` (with `δ` from equicontinuity), a finite value-net of the bounded range, classify
each `f` by the tuple of nearest value-net points at the centers, choose one representative per
class; equicontinuity plus the value-net make functions in the same class uniformly close on
`B_R`, and `dist_restrictToBall_le_of_ae_bound` (finite-measure sup→L² bound) turns that into
L²(B_R)-closeness. -/

/-- **FK step 2.**  Arzelà–Ascoli: a uniformly bounded, uniformly equicontinuous family of
continuous functions on the compact ball `B_R` is totally bounded in `C(B_R)`, hence (via the
continuous embedding `C(B_R) ↪ L²(B_R)` on a finite-measure ball) totally bounded in `L²(B_R)`.

Consumes `mollified_family_uniformly_bounded` (step 1a) and `mollified_family_equicontinuous`
(step 1b) for the CONCRETE kernel `K`; produces the total boundedness used by
`convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`.  The L²-classes `ρf f` whose representative is
`mollifyRep K (rep f)` are supplied (with the a.e. agreement hypothesis `hρf`) so the result
lands in `L²(B_R)` rather than `C(B_R)`.

**Norm-correctness (Codex Gate round 3 → resolved round 4).**  Both steps 1a/1b it consumes are
stated on `B_R` only and rest on the ENLARGED-BALL bound
`‖restrictToBall (R+K.supportRadius) (rep f)‖ ≤ C`, which the call site derives from
`FrechetKolmogorovInput`'s GLOBAL bound `hbddGlobal : ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` by ball-mass monotonicity.
Arzelà–Ascoli runs on the COMPACT ball `B_R`, where
the ball-restriction `restrictToBall R (ρf f)` lives, so the enlarged-ball sup/equicontinuity bounds
on `B_R` are exactly enough.  This lemma threads the same enlarged-ball bound `hbdEnl`. -/

/-! ### FK step 3 (assembly) — uniform L²-mollification approximate identity

Placed AFTER steps 1–2 so that its derivation may delegate the total-boundedness conjunct to
`mollified_family_totallyBounded_L2`. -/

/-- **FK step 3.**  Uniform L²-approximation of a translation-equicontinuous family by its
mollifications, for the CONCRETE mollifier.

If a family `{rep f | f ∈ S}` of L²(ℝ³) fields has a uniform L²-translation modulus
(the second hypothesis of `FrechetKolmogorovInput`), then for every tolerance `ε > 0` there is
an admissible smooth compactly supported kernel `K` and a choice of L²-classes `ρf : S → L2VF_R3`
whose chosen pointwise representative is `mollifyRep K (rep f)`, such that every member is within
`ε` in L² of its mollification:

  `∀ f ∈ S, ‖f − restrictToBall R (ρf f)‖ < ε`,

with the rate controlled UNIFORMLY over the family by the translation modulus.  The derivation
routes through the two named analytic helpers `young_convolution_memLp_L2` (global Young, producing
the `L²`-class `ρf f`) and `convolution_sub_L2_le_translation_modulus` (vector Minkowski, producing
the rate), the kernel constructor `exists_normalized_mollifierKernel`, and FK step 2
`mollified_family_totallyBounded_L2` (total boundedness).  This is the genuinely-missing analytic
core (mathlib has only the *pointwise* `convolution_tendsto_right`).

**Norm-correctness (Codex Gate round 3 → resolved round 4).**  The total-boundedness conjunct
delegates to `mollified_family_totallyBounded_L2` (steps 1+2), whose bounds need a ball-mass bound
on the kernel-support enlargement `B_{R+K.supportRadius}`.  The local hypothesis is an
ENLARGED-BALL bound at a fixed enlargement budget `r₀ ≥ 0`:
`hbdEnl : ∀ f ∈ S, ‖restrictToBall (R + r₀) (rep f)‖ ≤ C`, which the caller obtains directly from
`FrechetKolmogorovInput`'s GLOBAL bound `‖rep f‖ ≤ C` by ball-mass monotonicity (a single-radius
ball bound `‖f‖ ≤ C` alone would not control annulus mass, but the strengthened criterion carries
the global bound, so the enlarged bound is immediate).  The kernel `K` produced has support
radius `K.supportRadius ≤ r₀`, so by monotonicity of ball mass in the radius the step-3 bound on
`B_{R + K.supportRadius}` follows from `hbdEnl`.  The ball restriction bound `‖f‖ ≤ C` is retained
as `hbd` only for the L²-approximation conjunct (which compares ball-restrictions); it does NOT
control the convolution. -/

/-! ### DELIVERABLE — discharge of `FrechetKolmogorovInput` -/

/-- **DELIVERABLE.  Fréchet–Kolmogorov (Riesz) L²-precompactness criterion** — a genuine
discharge of `RellichBall.FrechetKolmogorovInput` (type copied verbatim, no weakening).

Assembles the standard mollification route: from the uniform L²-translation modulus
(`convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`, step 3) each family member is uniformly ε-approximated by its
mollification, whose image is totally bounded by Arzelà–Ascoli
(`mollified_family_totallyBounded_L2`, step 2); the transfer lemma
(`totallyBounded_of_uniform_approx`, step 4) makes `S` totally bounded, and completeness of
`L2ballR3 R` upgrades total boundedness to precompactness
(`isCompact_iff_totallyBounded_isComplete`), giving the compact `K ⊇ S`.

**Enlarged-ball bound — RESOLVED via the criterion's global bound (Codex Gate round 3, high).**
The helper lemmas (steps 1–3) require, honestly, an ENLARGED-BALL bound
`hbdEnl : ∀ f ∈ S, ‖restrictToBall (R + r₀) (rep f)‖ ≤ C` on the kernel-support enlargement
`B_{R+r₀}` (NOT just the single-radius ball bound `‖f‖ ≤ C`, which cannot prevent arbitrarily
large low-frequency mass on the annulus `B_{R+r₀} ∖ B_R`).

`FrechetKolmogorovInput`'s strengthened type hands the prover, beyond the in-ball bound `hbd` and
the translation modulus `hmod`, a uniform GLOBAL L²-norm bound on the representatives:
* `hbddGlobal : ∀ f ∈ S, ‖rep f‖ ≤ C`.

From `hbddGlobal` the enlarged-ball bound is IMMEDIATE for any `r₀ ≥ 0`, by monotonicity of ball
mass in the radius: `‖restrictToBall (R + r₀) (rep f)‖ ≤ ‖rep f‖ ≤ C` (the same
`restrict_le_self`/`eLpNorm_mono_measure` chain as `RellichBall.admissible_family_uniform_bound`).
This is the standard Riesz full-mass control of Fréchet–Kolmogorov; it carries no Sobolev/gradient
content.  The actual Navier–Stokes call site `localRellichInput_of_frechetKolmogorov` supplies it
from its admissible family's GLOBAL `‖w‖ ≤ M` bound.

**Assembly (pure proof-body fill, no upstream blocker).**  Derive `hbdEnl` from `hbddGlobal` by
ball-mass monotonicity; feed `hbdEnl`, `hbd`, `hrep`, `hmod` into `convolution_l2_tendsto_uniform`
(step 3) to get, for each `ε`, a totally bounded mollified image approximating `S` within `ε`;
`totallyBounded_of_uniform_approx` (step 4) makes `S` totally bounded; closure of the totally
bounded `S` is compact (`isCompact_iff_totallyBounded_isComplete`, `L2ballR3 R` complete); take
`K := closure S`. -/
