# Axiomatic closure of Leray–Hopf existence on ℝ³

**Milestone R3-c — ℝ³ axiomatic closure.**

Port of the Codex-approved T³ `LerayHopf/Torus/AxiomaticClosure.lean` to the whole-space
setting, reusing `DissipativeEvolution`, `WeakFormNS`, and `Time` verbatim.
The T³ 8-round audit lessons are baked in preemptively.

## Architecture

**ALL axioms are DISCHARGED — R3 capstone is KERNEL-ONLY (0 project axioms).**
SIX former project axioms are now removed: AX-SC (`spatial_compactness_R3`, THEOREM via the
Fréchet–Kolmogorov chain, issue #2), AX-G (`r3GalerkinScheme_exists`, THEOREM, issue #21),
AX-1 (`galerkin_ode_solution_R3`, discharged via the axiom-free `galerkinSolutionData_unconditional`
over `schemeOfBasis B`, issue #10), AX-4 (`r3ConvectionGapOp_exists`, PROVED sorry-free as
`r3ConvectionGapOp_holds`, issue #56), AX-2 (`aubin_lions_R3`, built axiom-free in
`AubinLionsAssembly.lean`, issue #4 PR-6), and AX-3 (`galerkin_limit_passage_R3`, PROVED as a
theorem in `LimitPassage.lean`, issue #4 PR-6).  The single extra (vs. T³) that T³ PROVED but
ℝ³ cannot supply concretely was isolated to the thin density `curlSchwartzDense_holds`
(discharged by the Fourier curl-density route, issue #3 / #21):

- **AX-G `r3GalerkinScheme_exists`** — the approximation-projection family
  (replaces T³'s proved `velocityProjection_n`); DISCHARGED (issue #21) — now a `theorem` in
  `SchwartzDivFreeBasis.lean` via `curlSchwartzDense_holds`, which is itself DISCHARGED
  (issue #3/#21, Fourier curl-density route in `CurlDensityCapstone.lean`) — no project axiom
  remains here.

The former AX-SC `spatial_compactness_R3` (local Rellich H¹(B_R)↪↪L²(B_R); replaces T³'s
proved `rellich_L2Sigma`; Rellich FAILS globally on ℝ³ but LOCAL convergence on every ball
is TRUE without tightness) is now PROVED here, not assumed.

ALL six former axioms are now discharged (AX-1 issue #10; AX-4 issue #56; AX-2 + AX-3 issue #4 PR-6):

- **AX-4 `r3_NSForms_exist` / `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists`** — PROVED (issue #56).  The named
  declaration `r3_NSForms_exist` was replaced (issue #48) by the operator-core declaration
  `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists`.  That declaration is now PROVED sorry-free as the theorem
  `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds` in `ConvectionExtension.lean` (C11, determined-form construction);
  the `r3_NSForms_exists` theorem is also moved there (rerouted from the old declaration to
  the proved theorem).  No project axiom remains for the convection operator.  `R3NSForms`
  itself is still the target type (defined below).  Mirrors torus #22 / #48.
- **AX-1 `galerkin_ode_solution_R3`** — Galerkin ODE global solution; DISCHARGED (issue #10),
  no longer an axiom — see `LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODECapstone.lean`.
- **AX-2 `aubin_lions_R3`** — Aubin–Lions time compactness; DISCHARGED (issue #4 PR-6),
  built axiom-free in `AubinLionsAssembly.lean` via `build_galerkin_package_R3_of_galSeq`.
- **AX-3 `galerkin_limit_passage_R3`** — limit passage to weak NS solution; DISCHARGED (issue #4
  PR-6), PROVED as a theorem in `LerayHopf/R3/LimitPassage.lean` — ∀t energy inequality + weak NS
  equation + initial trace + energy class, sorry-free.

`𝔊 : R3GalerkinScheme` is threaded as a parameter throughout (cleaner than
`.some` noise).

**Non-vacuity (issue #56):** Preserved via `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds` (same non-vacuity as
the former axiom).  The field `b_extends` + `convFormSchwartz_eq_witness` force
`b = convIntegralSchwartz` on Schwartz triples, excluding `b = 0`.  The non-vacuity pin is
inherited by `R3NSForms_of_gap` through its `b_galerkin` field derivation
(`b_galerkin ← b_extends + convFormSchwartz_eq_witness`), so `r3_NSForms_exists` still
excludes the trivial form.

**v4 de-axiomatization lesson applied:** The viscous (Stokes) form is the concrete
`stokesTestPairing_R3` — NOT axiomatized — for all `u : L2VF_R3`.

- `galerkin_limit_passage_R3`        : NO LONGER AN AXIOM — PROVED THEOREM (issue #4, PR-6, `LimitPassage.lean`): ∀t energy inequality + weak NS solution + initial trace + energy class; project R3 axiom count = 0

- `GalerkinCompactnessPackageFull_R3`: proof-carrying Galerkin compactness package

## Assumptions

**ALL axioms discharged — R3 capstone is KERNEL-ONLY (0 project axioms).**
`#print axioms exists_lerayHopf_r3_axiomatic` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
SIX former axioms are now DISCHARGED: AX-SC `spatial_compactness_R3` (issue #2, FK chain — item 4
below), AX-G `r3GalerkinScheme_exists` (issue #21 — item 1 below), AX-1
`galerkin_ode_solution_R3` (issue #10 — item 3 below; discharged downstream in
`GalerkinODECapstone.lean`), AX-4 `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists` (issue #56 — item 2 below;
proved sorry-free as `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds` in `ConvectionExtension.lean`), AX-2
`aubin_lions_R3` (issue #4, PR-6 — item 5 below; built axiom-free in `AubinLionsAssembly.lean`),
and AX-3 `galerkin_limit_passage_R3` (issue #4, PR-6 — item 6 below; proved as a theorem in
`LimitPassage.lean`).  The former fourth project axiom counted in place of AX-G is
`curlSchwartzDense_holds` (in `SchwartzDivFreeBasis.lean`), the thin density that AX-G was
swapped for; it is NOT assumed here.

1. `r3GalerkinScheme_exists` — NO LONGER AN AXIOM (DISCHARGED, issue #21). Existence of a
   Galerkin approximation-projection family on `L²_σ(ℝ³)` with smooth (Schwartz) range.  The
   `range_schwartz` field excludes `P = id` (L² ⊄ Schwartz), ensuring every Galerkin test
   field is Schwartz so `b_bound` and `reg_mem` are non-vacuous.  The `tendsto_id` field is
   RESTRICTED to `u ∈ L2Sigma_R3` (a divergence-free Galerkin scheme is total only in
   `L²_σ(ℝ³)`; an unrestricted `∀ u : L2VF_R3` form was a latent over-strength, removed).
   Now PROVED as the `theorem` `r3GalerkinScheme_exists` in `SchwartzDivFreeBasis.lean`,
   assembled from P5 `nonempty_r3GalerkinScheme_of_basis` (`GalerkinScheme.lean`) and the
   single marked density axiom `curlSchwartzDense_holds` — the SWAP that replaced this 6-field
   structure axiom with a thin `Submodule` density `Prop` (net project-axiom count unchanged).
   Lemarié-Rieusset §2.

2. `r3_NSForms_exist` / `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists` — NO LONGER AXIOMS (PROVED, issue #56).
   The reorganization in issue #48 replaced `r3_NSForms_exist` with the operator-core axiom
   `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists` (five fields).  Issue #56 proved all five fields sorry-free via
   the determined-form construction (`ConvectionExtension.lean`, C11 `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds`):
   the BLT extension on the submodule `D = (𝒮 ⊗ L²_σ) + (L²_σ ⊗ 𝒮)` supplies `b_cont_fixedTest`
   genuinely (not as an axiom), because slot-3 Schwartz inputs land in the determined domain.
   The proved theorem `r3_NSForms_exists` (same conclusion `Nonempty (R3NSForms 𝔊)`, no
   statement weakening) is now in `ConvectionExtension.lean`.  Net: the convection operator
   contributes ZERO project axioms to the capstone.  Temam II.§1; Lemarié-Rieusset §5.

3. `galerkin_ode_solution_R3` — NO LONGER AN AXIOM (DISCHARGED, issue #10).  Picard–Lindelöf
   on the finite-dimensional approximation subspace + uniform energy and regularity bounds.
   Now PROVED unconditionally over the concrete scheme `schemeOfBasis B` via
   `galerkinSolutionData_unconditional` (`LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODESolve.lean`), which rests on
   the proved finite-dim ODE solver `finDimGlobalODE_exists`; the capstone is rerouted through
   that data in `LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODECapstone.lean`.  Temam III.3, Theorem 3.1.

4. `spatial_compactness_R3` — NO LONGER AN AXIOM (DISCHARGED, issue #2). ℝ³ LOCAL spatial
   compactness = local Rellich H¹(B_R)↪↪L²(B_R). Concludes convergence on every ball B_R
   (NOT global strong L²(ℝ³)); no tightness premise required. Now PROVED via
   `localCompactness_R3_of_ballCompact ∘ localRellichInput_of_frechetKolmogorov ∘
   frechetKolmogorov_holds` (the sorry-free Fréchet–Kolmogorov chain; `#print axioms`
   shows kernel axioms only). Leray 1934; Lemarié-Rieusset §6.

5. `aubin_lions_R3` — NO LONGER AN AXIOM (DISCHARGED, issue #4, PR-6). Aubin–Lions time
   compactness; spatial half supplied as the LOCAL `spatial_compactness_R3` hypothesis
   (ball-restricted convergence, no tightness).  The time-compactness half is now built
   axiom-free in `AubinLionsAssembly.lean` via `build_galerkin_package_R3_of_galSeq` (threaded
   `htest : R3TestApproxH1 𝔊`).  Temam III.2.1.

6. `galerkin_limit_passage_R3` — NO LONGER AN AXIOM (PROVED THEOREM, issue #4, PR-6).
   Limit passage from the strong-L²(0,T) subsequence to a weak NS solution with energy
   inequality, initial trace, and energy class.  Proved sorry-free in
   `LerayHopf/R3/LimitPassage.lean`: Fatou + liminf superadditivity → ∀t energy ineq;
   `weakFormNS_limit_passage` + `ae_restrict_iff'` + `intervalIntegral.integral_congr_ae`
   → weak NS equation; `strong_trace_of_props_R3` → initial trace.  Temam III.3.

/-! ### AX-G: Galerkin approximation-projection scheme on L²_σ(ℝ³) -/

/-- The Galerkin approximation-projection family on `L²(ℝ³; ℝ³)`.

Bundles the `n`-indexed family of continuous projectors `P n : L2VF_R3 →L[ℝ] L2VF_R3`
with the five key properties needed for the Galerkin construction:

- `preserves_sigma`: each `P n` maps `L2Sigma_R3` into itself (the approximation respects
  the divergence-free constraint; follows for frequency-ball truncation or mollification);
- `tendsto_id`: `P n u → u` in `L²` as `n → ∞` **for every `u ∈ L2Sigma_R3`** (strong
  convergence of the approximation on the divergence-free subspace; Paley–Wiener
  approximation theory).  The convergence is RESTRICTED to `L2Sigma_R3`: a divergence-free
  Galerkin scheme is total only in `L²_σ(ℝ³)`, never in all of `L²(ℝ³; ℝ³)` (its prefix-span
  projections land in the closed div-free subspace, so an unrestricted `∀ u : L2VF_R3` form
  would force every `u` to be divergence-free — a latent over-strength, Codex-confirmed).
  Every consumer applies `P n` only to div-free data, so the Σ-restriction is exactly what
  the Leray–Hopf assembly needs;
- `norm_le`: `‖P n u‖ ≤ ‖u‖` (non-expansiveness; follows e.g. from the fact that `P n` is
  the L² projection onto a subspace);
- `idem`: `P n ∘ P n = P n` (idempotence; `P n` is a projection);
- `range_schwartz`: every element of the range of `P n` has Schwartz component
  representatives (excludes `P = id` since `L²(ℝ³) ⊄ Schwartz(ℝ³)`; ensures every
  `IsGalerkinTest_R3` field is Schwartz so `b_bound` and `reg_mem`/H¹ apply). -/

  preserves_sigma : ∀ (n : ℕ) (u : L2VF_R3), u ∈ L2Sigma_R3 → P n u ∈ L2Sigma_R3
  /-- Strong convergence on the divergence-free subspace: `P n u → u` in `L²` for every
  `u ∈ L2Sigma_R3`.  The Σ-restriction is mathematically necessary — a div-free Galerkin
  scheme is total only in `L²_σ(ℝ³)`, not in all of `L²(ℝ³; ℝ³)` — and is exactly the
  range used by every consumer (`P n` is only ever applied to div-free data). -/

  /-- Idempotence: P n (P n u) = P n u. -/
  idem : ∀ (n : ℕ) (u : L2VF_R3), P n (P n u) = P n u
  /-- **Range regularity (Schwartz):** every element in the range of `P n` has component-wise
  Schwartz representatives.  Concretely: for every `n` and `u : L2VF_R3`, there exist
  Schwartz functions `ψ : Fin 3 → 𝓢(Domain3, ℝ)` such that the `j`-th component of
  `P n u` equals `(ψ j).toLp 2 volume`.

  This field excludes `P n = id` (since L²(ℝ³) ⊄ Schwartz(ℝ³)); as a consequence every
  `IsGalerkinTest_R3 𝔊 w` field is component-wise Schwartz, making `b_bound` (smooth-test
  bound) and `reg_mem` (H¹ regularity) non-vacuous.  Smooth/Hermite Galerkin bases
  satisfy this. -/

        (ψ j).toLp 2 (volume : Measure Domain3)
  /-- **Subspace nesting / eventual test-fixing.** If `w` is fixed by an earlier projector
  `P m` (i.e. `w ∈ range (P m)`), it stays fixed by all later projectors `P n`, `n ≥ m`.
  For the concrete witness (`galerkinP B n = orthogonal projection onto the nested prefix span
  `galerkinSpan B n`), this holds by `galerkinSpan_mono` + orthogonal-projection-fixes-its-subspace.
  Required for the uniform-in-`n` per-test time-derivative bound in the initial-trace route. -/
  mono_range : ∀ (m n : ℕ), m ≤ n → ∀ (w : L2VF_R3), P m w = w → P n w = w

/-! **Former axiom AX-G — now DISCHARGED (issue #21).** A Galerkin approximation-projection
family on `L²_σ(ℝ³)` exists.  No longer an axiom: it is proved as the `theorem`
`r3GalerkinScheme_exists` in `LerayHopf/R3/SchwartzDivFreeBasis.lean`, assembled from the
constructive witness P5 (`nonempty_r3GalerkinScheme_of_basis`) and the single marked density
input `curlSchwartzDense_holds`.  The proof lives downstream (it needs the witness chain,
which imports this file), so the structure `R3GalerkinScheme` stays here while its
inhabitation moves one level down the import DAG.  The capstone `exists_lerayHopf_r3_axiomatic`
is relocated further downstream to `LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODECapstone.lean` (issue #10), below
both `SchwartzDivFreeBasis` and the axiom-free ODE chain it now routes through. -/

/-! ### Galerkin test predicate for ℝ³ -/

/-- A vector `w ∈ L²_σ(ℝ³)` is a **Galerkin test function** (relative to scheme `𝔊`) if
it is a fixed point of some approximation projector:
  `IsGalerkinTest_R3 𝔊 w ↔ ∃ n, 𝔊.P n (w : L2VF_R3) = (w : L2VF_R3)`.

Mirrors `IsGalerkinTest` on T³.  Every element of the range of `𝔊.P n` satisfies this.
The class is dense in `L²_σ(ℝ³)` (by `𝔊.tendsto_id`, the Σ-restricted strong convergence)
and is the standard Faedo–Galerkin
test class used in the weak NS formulation. -/
def IsGalerkinTest_R3 (𝔊 : R3GalerkinScheme) (w : L2Sigma_R3) : Prop :=
  ∃ n : ℕ, 𝔊.P n (w : L2VF_R3) = (w : L2VF_R3)

/-- The H¹(graph-norm) test-approximation property for an `R3GalerkinScheme`.

Every canonical Schwartz divergence-free test `w` is approximable, in the combined
`L² + viscousFormSq` graph seminorm, by Galerkin test fields of the scheme `𝔊`.
This is the hypothesis threaded into `galerkin_limit_passage_R3` (issue #4 PR-3/PR-4)
to bridge the `WeakFormNS` test extension step (W2): `𝔊.tendsto_id` is L²-only and
does not control `viscousFormSq_R3(P_N w − w)`.

The predicate lives here — upstream of `AubinLionsLimitPassage` and the capstone chain —
so it can be imported by both without introducing a cycle.  It is NOT a structure field
of `R3GalerkinScheme` (route decision R2 in the architect plan, issue #93). -/
def R3TestApproxH1 (𝔊 : R3GalerkinScheme) : Prop :=

        viscousFormSq_R3 1 ((v : L2VF_R3) - (w : L2VF_R3)) < ε

/-! ### AX-4: ℝ³ Navier–Stokes forms structure -/

/-- The bundle of ℝ³ Navier–Stokes forms: only the trilinear convection form `b`
(the viscous form is the concrete `stokesTestPairing_R3`, NOT axiomatized).

Mirrors `Torus3NSForms` with `L2Sigma_R3` in place of `L2Sigma`.  The `𝔊 : R3GalerkinScheme`
parameter is threaded so that the evolution `r3Evolution 𝔊 F` can reference the Galerkin
projection `𝔊.P n`.  The pin `b_galerkin` uses Schwartz component witnesses
(`L2VF_projComponent_R3 j`) directly — independent of `𝔊` — to pin `b` to
`convIntegralSchwartz` on Schwartz div-free fields.

**Non-vacuity:** `b_galerkin` pins `b` to `convIntegralSchwartz` (the genuine
`∑_{i,a} ∫ u_a (∂_a v_i) w_i` convection integral) on Schwartz div-free fields.
This excludes `b := 0` since `convIntegralSchwartz ≢ 0` on a concrete Schwartz triple.

**Antisymmetry convention:** `b u v w = -b u w v` (skew in the last two slots).

**Smooth-test convection bound:** For a **canonical Schwartz divergence-free** test `w`
(`IsSchwartzDivFree_R3 w`), `|b(u,v,w)| ≤ C(w)·‖u‖·‖v‖`.  This uses the full
(scheme-independent) test class, matching the weak NS formulation in `r3Evolution`. -/

  /-- ℝ-homogeneity in the third slot. -/
  b_smul_3 : ∀ (c : ℝ) (u v w : L2Sigma_R3), b u v (c • w) = c * b u v w
  /-- **Smooth-test convection bound:** For a Schwartz divergence-free test `w`, the
  convection form is L²-bounded in the first two slots:
  `|b(u,v,w)| ≤ C(w) · ‖u‖_{L²} · ‖v‖_{L²}`.
  TRUE: `b(u,v,w) = -∫(u·∇)w·v`, so `|b| ≤ ‖∇w‖_∞ ‖u‖_{L²} ‖v‖_{L²}` with
  `‖∇w‖_∞ < ∞` for `IsSchwartzDivFree_R3 w` (Schwartz functions have all derivatives
  bounded).  Correct shape for strong-L²(0,T) convergence in the nonlinear limit passage.
  This covers the CANONICAL test class used in the weak NS formulation. -/
  b_bound : ∀ (w : L2Sigma_R3), IsSchwartzDivFree_R3 w →
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ (u v : L2Sigma_R3),
      |b u v w| ≤ C * ‖(u : L2VF_R3)‖ * ‖(v : L2VF_R3)‖
  /-- **Non-vacuity pin (genuine):** `b` agrees with `convIntegralSchwartz` on L²_σ fields
  that are component-wise represented by Schwartz witnesses (via `L2VF_projComponent_R3`).

  Concretely: given `ψu ψv ψw : Fin 3 → 𝓢(Domain3, ℝ)` such that each component projection
  `L2VF_projComponent_R3 j (u : L2VF_R3) = (ψu j).toLp 2 volume` (and similarly for `v`, `w`),
  we require `b u v w = convIntegralSchwartz ψu ψv ψw`.

  This is the **faithful** non-vacuity pin: `convIntegralSchwartz` is the genuine
  `∑_{i,a} ∫ u_a (∂_a v_i) w_i` convection integral (not a calibration constant), so
  `b = 0` is excluded (the genuine convection form does not vanish on all Schwartz triples).
  The Schwartz div-free set is dense in `L²_σ(ℝ³)`, so the pin constrains `b` on a dense
  subset — sufficient for faithfulness. -/

/-! ### AX-4 PROVED (issue #56) — `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists` proved as `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds`

The operator-core axiom `r3ConvectionGapOp_exists` (which replaced `r3_NSForms_exist` in
issue #48) is NOW PROVED sorry-free as the theorem `r3ConvectionGapOp_holds` in
`LerayHopf/R3/ConvectionExtension.lean` (C11, determined-form construction).  It is NO
LONGER an axiom anywhere in the codebase.

- The five `ConvectionGapOp` fields are all proved: `b` = `convFormL2_def` (C6),
  `b_extends` (C9), `b_multilinear` (C7), `b_antisymm_gap` (C8), `b_cont_fixedTest` (C10).
- `b_cont_fixedTest` is now genuinely PROVED (not assumed): for Schwartz `w`, the tensor
  `v ⊗ₜ w` lands in the determined domain `D`, so the value is the BLT-controlled quantity,
  not a Hamel value — the determined-form payoff.
- The proved theorem `r3_NSForms_exists` (same conclusion `Nonempty (R3NSForms 𝔊)`, no
  statement weakening) is also now in `ConvectionExtension.lean`.
- `R3NSForms` (the structure) remains intact — it is still the target type.
- Net project axioms for the R3 capstone: **0** — `exists_lerayHopf_r3_axiomatic` is KERNEL-ONLY
  (`#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). -/

/-! ### Dissipative evolution from ℝ³ NS forms (sorry-free) -/

/-- Build a `DissipativeEvolution` from an `R3GalerkinScheme` and an `R3NSForms`.

`H := L2Sigma_R3`, with the `L2Sigma_R3`-subspace instances inherited from `L2VF_R3`.
The regularity functional is `viscousFormSq_R3 1 ∘ (↑)` (matching the design doc:
`reg := viscousFormSq_R3 1`), the viscous form is the concrete `stokesTestPairing_R3`,
the convection form is `F.b`, and the test predicate is the **canonical**
`IsSchwartzDivFree_R3` (Schwartz divergence-free test class — scheme-independent).

Using `IsSchwartzDivFree_R3` here (rather than `IsGalerkinTest_R3 𝔊`) ensures that
`WeakFormNS … (r3Evolution 𝔊 F) u` is tested against the full Schwartz div-free class,
which is the correct formulation for the whole-space Leray–Hopf weak equation.

This construction is **sorry-free**: `DissipativeEvolution` carries no Galerkin or
compactness fields. -/

/-! ### AX-1 (DISCHARGED, issue #10): Galerkin ODE existence on ℝ³ — now a THEOREM

The former `axiom galerkin_ode_solution_R3` is REMOVED.  The `n`-th finite-dimensional
Galerkin ODE has a global solution unconditionally over the concrete scheme `schemeOfBasis B`
via `galerkinSolutionData_unconditional` (`LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODESolve.lean`), which rests on
the proved finite-dim ODE solver `finDimGlobalODE_exists` (Picard–Lindelöf on the
finite-dimensional approximation subspace + the energy estimate
`‖uₙ(t)‖ ≤ ‖𝔊.P n u₀‖ ≤ ‖u₀‖`).  The capstone `exists_lerayHopf_r3_axiomatic` is rerouted
through that concrete data in `LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODECapstone.lean`, so it no longer depends
on any per-scheme ODE axiom.  Temam III.3, Theorem 3.1. -/

/-! ### AX-SC: Spatial compactness on ℝ³ (LOCAL — no tightness) — now a THEOREM -/

/-- **AX-SC (now a theorem):** LOCAL spatial compactness on ℝ³ — the ℝ³ replacement for
`rellich_L2Sigma`.

Rellich's theorem FAILS globally on ℝ³, but the LOCAL version holds: given uniform L²
and H¹ bounds, there is a subsequence `z (ψ n)` and a limit `g ∈ L²_σ(ℝ³)` such that
`z (ψ n)` converges to `g` in L² on every ball `{x | ‖x‖ ≤ R}`.

No tightness hypothesis is needed: local Rellich `H¹(B_R) ↪↪ L²(B_R)` (compact embedding)
is unconditional; a diagonal argument over growing balls extracts the subsequence.
This is the genuine Leray 1934 construction.

**DISCHARGED (issue #2).** Formerly the `axiom spatial_compactness_R3`, this is now PROVED
(no new axiom; kernel axioms only) by composing the sorry-free Fréchet–Kolmogorov chain:
`localCompactness_R3_of_ballCompact (localRellichInput_of_frechetKolmogorov frechetKolmogorov_holds)`.
The statement is byte-identical to the former axiom; consumers (`aubin_lions_R3` spatial
slot, `build_galerkin_package_R3_of_galSeq`) are unchanged.  Verified via `#print axioms`: the chain
depends only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` (no `sorryAx`). -/

/-! ### AX-2: Aubin–Lions compactness package on ℝ³ -/

/-- Package produced by the Aubin–Lions theorem on ℝ³.

Parameterized by `galSeq` (a Galerkin sequence from AX-1), enforcing chain faithfulness
(A1 → A2 → A3 all operate on the same sequence).  Carries: the extracted subsequence `φ`,
its strict monotonicity, a limit curve `u`, and LOCAL space-time convergence.

**LOCAL convergence:** `strong_convergence` asserts convergence in L²(0,T; L²(B_R)) for
every ball radius R — this is the form supported by the local `spatial_compactness_R3`
(no tightness needed).  The Schwartz test functions in `b_bound` have rapid decay, so
the tail outside B_R is controlled uniformly under the H¹ bound.

The spatial compactness half is NOT in this package — it is supplied as an explicit
hypothesis to `aubin_lions_R3` (the type matches `spatial_compactness_R3` exactly). -/

  /-- **Time-measurability of the limit curve:** `t ↦ (u t : L2VF_R3)` is
  `AEStronglyMeasurable` with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to `[0, T]`.

  This is the minimal time-regularity field: it asserts ONLY that the map `t ↦ u t`
  (coerced to `L2VF_R3`) is almost-everywhere strongly measurable in time — NOT
  continuity, NOT a Bochner-time-derivative, NOT a weak trace, NOT membership in an
  energy class (those belong to the good-representative layer above this package).
  It enables the a.e.-in-`t` norm-lsc transfer in `kineticEnergy_lsc_bound` (E1):
  measurability of `t ↦ ‖(u t : L2VF_R3)‖` makes `g_n(t) = ∫_{B_R} ‖uₙ t − u t‖²`
  measurable in `t`, which `TendstoInMeasure.exists_seq_tendsto_ae` needs. -/

  `[0,T]`) tends to `0` along the subsequence `φ`.

  **eLpNorm-form (issue #31, owner-approved 2026-06-21).** This is the FAITHFUL encoding of
  L²(0,T; L²(B_R)) convergence. The earlier Bochner interval-integral form
  `∫₀ᵀ ∫_{B_R} ‖uₙ − u‖² → 0` was vacuous-shaped: Lean's `integral_undef` makes the inner
  Bochner integral `0` for non-integrable integrands, so that form was satisfiable with junk-`0`
  per-`n` integrals — it could NOT certify `MemLp (fun t => restrictToBall R (u t)) 2 …`, which
  blocks E1 (`kineticEnergy_lsc_bound`). The `eLpNorm` form has no junk-`0` collapse and carries
  exactly the intended content; it strengthens the field's *statement* (the axiom's type) without
  adding any axiom.

  This is the LOCAL form (ball-restricted via `restrictToBall`), supported by the local
  `spatial_compactness_R3` (no tightness).  Sufficient for the nonlinear limit passage since
  `b_bound` test fields are Schwartz (rapid decay controls the tail). -/

strictly-thinner `galerkinSpaceTimeExtraction_R3` (the LOCAL Bochner-time compactness extraction —
per-ball a.e.-in-time L² convergence, not global; mathlib lacks the Bochner-valued
Fréchet–Kolmogorov / Aubin–Lions theorem in `L²(0,T;X)`).
The `AubinLionsPackage_R3` is now produced by `aubinLionsPackage_R3_of_timeCompactness`
(`LerayHopf/R3/AubinLionsLimitPassage.lean`), which is DOWNSTREAM of this file, so the package
assembly (`build_galerkin_package_R3_of_galSeq`) is RELOCATED to the downstream

The former axiom `galerkin_limit_passage_R3` (AX-3) has been **proved** and

the extra hypothesis `htest : R3TestApproxH1 𝔊` (the H¹-graph test-approximation

/-! **Main existence theorem on ℝ³ (axiomatic) — RELOCATED (issue #10).**

`exists_lerayHopf_r3_axiomatic` now lives in `LerayHopf/R3/GalerkinODECapstone.lean`,
downstream of this file.  The relocation is forced by the issue-#10 discharge of
`galerkin_ode_solution_R3`: the capstone sources its per-`n` Galerkin sequence from the
axiom-free `galerkinSolutionData_unconditional` (`GalerkinODESolve.lean`) over the concrete
scheme `schemeOfBasis B` (with `B` from `nonempty_schwartzGalerkinBasis`).  That ODE chain
imports this file, so the capstone must sit below it in the DAG to stay acyclic.  The building
blocks it uses (`r3_NSForms_exists` — now a THEOREM in `ConvectionForm.lean` via the
thin-swap (issue #48), `build_galerkin_package_R3_of_galSeq`,
`exists_lerayHopf_from_package_full_R3`) remain defined here or in upstream imports and are
visible downstream through the import.  See `LerayHopf/Core.lean` for the axiom-free layer; `LerayHopf/R3Axiomatic.lean`
re-exports the relocated capstone. -/
