# Abstract energy inequality

**Must-prove, sorry-free.** A purely abstract, PDE-free formulation of the energy
inequality and one nontrivial consequence: if the dissipation is nonnegative and the
viscosity is nonnegative, the energy is nonincreasing. This checks that the formalization
is more than a collection of records.

The accumulated-dissipation form (`A : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ`) is used per the original MVP plan's
design decision; the interval-integral form was considered as a later refinement but not
adopted. Design-decision reference (archived, historical): `docs/archive/leray_hopf_lean_mvp_plan.md`
(Milestone E).
