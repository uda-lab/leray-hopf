# LerayHopf.Bochner.TimeConvolution — Stream D / PR-F3 (S1 sub-module 1: whole-line Young)

**Stream:** D (abstract Bochner–Sobolev-in-time). **Origin:** the SPIKE-1 S1 wall isolated in
`LerayHopf/Bochner/TimeMollification.lean` (`timeMollification_exists`). The team-lead sequenced
the S1 build into bounded sub-modules; THIS file is the FIRST one: the whole-line `eLpNorm`
Young bound for a Banach-valued time-convolution, plus the documented interval-boundary design.

This file is domain-NEUTRAL and abstract in the Banach space `E`, so it applies to both the
regularity space `V` and the dual `V'` of a Gelfand triple (the two convergences
`conv_uV : L²(0,T;V)` and `conv_uV' : L²(0,T;V')` reuse the same bound).

## What this file provides (this sub-module)

- `IsTimeMollifier ρ` — the abstract mollifier bundle: `ρ : ℝ → ℝ` continuous, nonnegative,
  with compact support and unit mass `∫ ρ = 1`. `ContDiffBump.normed volume` is the canonical
  instance (continuous, nonneg, compact support, `integral_normed = 1`); keeping the predicate
  abstract makes the bound reusable and avoids committing to a specific bump at this layer.
- `timeTranslateL2 h g` — the time-translation `τ_h g = g(· + h)` on the Bochner space
  `Lp E 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)`, realized as `Lp.compMeasurePreserving` of the
  measure-preserving shift (an isometry).
- `timeConvL2 ρ g` — the time-convolution `ρ ⋆ₜ g` realized as a genuine element of
  `Lp E 2 (volume : Measure ℝ)`, the Bochner integral `∫ h, ρ h • τ_h g ∂volume` valued in
  that Banach space (no `MemLp` side-condition: the integrand is Bochner integrable because it
  is continuous with compact support — the mollifier kills the tails).
- **`timeConvL2_norm_le`** — the **`eLpNorm` Young bound** at the `Lp`-element level:
  `‖ρ ⋆ₜ g‖ ≤ ‖g‖`. This is the entire norm content of Young's inequality for a unit-mass
  kernel, via `‖∫ F‖ ≤ ∫ ‖F‖` (`norm_integral_le_integral_norm`) + translation isometry +
  `∫ ρ = 1`. **Proved sorry-free.** (Mirrors `FrechetKolmogorov.convL2_norm_le`, the whole-space
  spatial model, transported to the time line and abstracted in `E`.)

## Interval-boundary design (the crux — documented, scaffolded for the next sub-module)

The whole-line bound above is clean precisely because time-translation preserves `volume` on
`ℝ`. The genuine S1 wall is the INTERVAL `[0,T]`: a `W1pTime` curve lives on `[0,T]`, and
time-translation does NOT preserve `[0,T]`; naive zero-extension off `[0,T]` injects a boundary
jump that the weak `V'`-derivative sees (a Dirac term at `0` and `T`), breaking the commutation
`(ρᵋ ⋆ ιu)' = ρᵋ ⋆ u'`. The chosen sound approach and the lemma signatures the next sub-module
must fill are written out as a DESIGN NOTE in the closing `section`-comment of this file (prose,
not `sorry`-bearing declarations — they belong to the next sub-module's file, keeping THIS file
fully `sorry`-free).

## Assumptions

No new `axiom`/`opaque`/`constant`, and **zero `sorry`**. The whole-line Young bound
(`timeConvL2_norm_le`) and all its supporting lemmas are fully proved. The interval-boundary
approach is a documented design note only; nothing is weakened and no axiom is introduced.

/-! ### Abstract mollifier bundle

`IsTimeMollifier ρ` packages exactly the four properties of a normalized mollifier that the
Young bound consumes. `ContDiffBump.normed volume` satisfies all four. -/

kernel on the line with unit mass. This is precisely what `ContDiffBump.normed volume` provides
(`continuous_normed`, `nonneg_normed`, `hasCompactSupport_normed`, `integral_normed = 1`), kept
abstract so the Young bound applies to any such kernel. -/

/-- **The whole-line `eLpNorm` Young bound (PROVED, sorry-free).**

`‖ρ ⋆ₜ g‖ ≤ ‖g‖` for a unit-mass mollifier `ρ`. This is the entire norm content of Young's
convolution inequality `‖ρ ⋆ g‖₂ ≤ ‖ρ‖₁ · ‖g‖₂` with `‖ρ‖₁ = ∫ ρ = 1`: it follows from
`‖∫ F‖ ≤ ∫ ‖F‖` in the Banach space `L²(ℝ;E)` (`norm_integral_le_integral_norm`),
`‖ρ h • τ_h g‖ = ρ h · ‖g‖` (translation isometry + nonneg kernel), and `∫ ρ = 1`.

This is the time-line, `E`-abstract transport of `FrechetKolmogorov.convL2_norm_le` (the
whole-space spatial model). It is the foundational reusable piece of the S1 build: the same
bound serves the `L²(0,T;V)` and `L²(0,T;V')` convergences once the interval layer lands. -/

/-! ### Interval-boundary design (scaffold for the next S1 sub-module)

**The wall.** A `W1pTime GT 2 2 T uV` curve `uV : ℝ → V` is controlled only on `[0,T]`
(`MemLp` on `volume.restrict (Icc 0 T)`), with a weak `V'`-derivative `u'` likewise on `[0,T]`.
The whole-line Young bound above needs a curve on all of `ℝ`. Time-translation does not preserve
`[0,T]`, and zero-extension off `[0,T]` is UNSOUND for the derivative: the extended curve jumps
at the endpoints, so its weak `V'`-derivative acquires boundary Dirac terms and the commutation
`(ρᵋ ⋆ ιu)' = ρᵋ ⋆ u'` FAILS.

**Chosen sound approach: a `W1pTime`-preserving whole-line extension.** Extend `uV` to
`ūV : ℝ → V` on all of `ℝ` so that (i) `ūV = uV` a.e. on `[0,T]`, (ii) `ūV ∈ L²(ℝ;V)`, and
(iii) the `V'`-image `t ↦ ι(ūV t)` has a whole-line weak `V'`-derivative `ū'` with
`ū' = u'` a.e. on `[0,T]` and `ū' ∈ L²(ℝ;V')`. The standard construction is a **Sobolev
reflection/extension** (even reflection at each endpoint, multiplied by a fixed cutoff to keep
compact support), which is bounded `L²(ℝ;V) ∩ {u' ∈ L²(ℝ;V')}` and matches the trace so no
boundary jump is created — the weak derivative of the reflected extension is the reflection of
the derivative (no Dirac term). Then mollify the EXTENSION on the whole line with the bound
above, and RESTRICT the result back to `[0,T]`: on `[0,T]` the restriction sees only the genuine
curve, and the convergence transfers because `eLpNorm` over `Icc 0 T ⊆ ℝ` is monotone under
`eLpNorm` over `ℝ` (`eLpNorm_mono_measure` / `restrict_le_self`).

The lemma signatures the next sub-module must build and discharge (in its OWN file, so this
file stays `sorry`-free):

- `w1pTime_lineExtension` — the extension `ūV` with the three properties above;
- `eLpNorm_restrict_le_line` — convergence transfer `[0,T] ⊆ ℝ` (a one-line `eLpNorm_mono_measure`);
- `timeConvL2_tendsto_self` — the `eLpNorm`-mollification convergence `‖ρᵋ ⋆ₜ g − g‖₂ → 0` on the
  whole line (ε/3: continuous-dense `MemLp.exists_boundedContinuous_eLpNorm_sub_le` + the Young
  bound above + `ContDiffBump.convolution_tendsto_right` pointwise; the genuinely-new assembled
  theorem, but now resting on the proved Young bound);
- `timeConvL2_weakDeriv_comm` — the commutation `(ρᵋ ⋆ₜ ιu)' = ρᵋ ⋆ₜ u'` in the
  `IsWeakTimeDeriv` sense, via `isWeakTimeDeriv_comp_clm` / `hToVprimeCLM` (convolution is a
  continuous-linear time operation).

These are stated in `TimeMollification.lean`'s eventual constructor, not here; this file's
contract is the whole-line Young bound, which is proved. The design note above fixes the
interval approach so the next sub-module does not re-litigate soundness. -/
